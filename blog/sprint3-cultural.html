    <h1>Sprint 3 Cultural - Emotional Intelligence (EQ/EI)</h1>

    <h2>What is emotional intelligence?
    </h2>
    <p>In the words of our dearest friend, Wikipedia, Emotional intelligence "is the capability of individuals to recognize their own emotions and those of others, discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior, and manage and/or adjust emotions to adapt to environments or achieve one's goal(s)."
    </p>
    <p>In short, it is the ability to understand emotions.
    </p>

    <h2>How is it different to IQ?
    </h2>
    <p>IQ (intelligence quotient) is the measure of ones knowledge, often associated with logical reasoning, problem solving, spatial thinking, maths, etc. EQ on the other hand, is the measure of ones emotional capabilities, and is weighed by ones ability to identify, evaluate, control their own and assess others' emotions.
    </p>
    <p>IQ will usually correlate with someone's technical capabilities, but EQ will be the factor when someone's teamwork, leadership or relationships are involved.
    </p>


    <h2>Why is it important?
    </h2>
    <p>Working as a develope will almost always require you to work in a team environment, and working in a team is more than being a smart individual. If a team is unable to work together, things will begin to fall apart and work will not be done.
    </p>
    <p>This is where the importance of EQ comes into play. No matter how smart someone may be, in order to work in a team, they require to understand the emotions of others. Work is often collaborative, and without EQ, collaboration often becomes difficult. Also, a lot of success these days are driven by EQ as it plays a massive role in leadership and people skills.
    </p>
    <p>IQ is recognised as an important element of success, especially academic, but in order to succeed further, EQ becomes a requisite. Many people with high IQ often destroy their career due to the lack of EQ. It's hard to gauge which is more important - IQ was certainly deemed more important decades ago - but recent studies are showing that EQ may be the more important factor today.
