    <h1>Sprint 5 Cultural - Personal Reflections</h1>

    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>1. That my mind isn't fixed, and that I should have a Growth Mindset to help me learn.
       Not only will this make my learning easier, it will make it more efficient.
      <br>
       2. Emotional Intelligence plays a major part in the life of a developer.
       In order to form an excellent relationship with your colleagues requires emotional intelligence.
       Many successful people are where they are because of emotional intelligence as well.
       <br>
       3. My ego is probably the biggest reason that I won't develop as a person.
       Thinking whatever I believe is true, is probably the biggest reason I will not develop.
       I need to be critical, not only with what others say to me, but to myself as well.
    </p>

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>
    <p>Values are not fixed, and have no black and white definitions, but are displayed on a spectrum.
       Just because one person's value is correct to them, doesn't mean it has to be for another person.
       This is where empathy comes into factor. The ability to understand and share with others allows relationships to form.
       Being empathetic not only helps others, but will also let you develop yourself. Learning and programming are both
       things that benefit from such characteristics. We must be able to have a flexible mindset and accept the fact
       that what we believe is wrong or right may not be so, and with the help of others, it is not only easier, but better
       when we are learning and solving problems.
    </p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>Living life gets busy, and seldom do you get the chance to hear yourself in this busy and loud world.
       Having time to self-reflect has given me an opportunity to look back at myself and see how I've changed
       and what I want to do. I saw the deficits that I had at a 'core' level, and the core learnings have
       provided me with a means to develop myself, and that I find has been such a great experiece, and a delightful surprise.
    </p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>With age, many become stubborn, and I swore to myself that I would not be as such in the future.
       Looking back at myself through reflection, I saw and realised that I had become that stubborn person.
       The most challenging part was accepting that I needed to change, and improve.
       It was about me accepting that I am not as good as I am, and that I needed improvement.
    </p>

    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>A team is composed of not one, but many people, each with different backgrounds, cultures, upbringings, beliefs, and the list continues.
       One person can destroy a team from the inside.
       By learning of such core values, we will be better suited to work in team environments, and will be better candidates for employment.
       Plus, if two people had the same technical skills, who would you like to work with?
       One is unpleasant, and the other is a blessing to society. I would want to be working with the blessing.
    </p>

    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>The time spent studying core did not feel like a waste of time at all. I would say we studied technical:core 8:2.
       Spending some time to improve ourselves is an important investment, and I am grateful that I've had such a great opportunity to
       develop my core and learn more on becoming a better person.
    </p>
