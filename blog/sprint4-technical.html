    <h1>Sprint 4 Technical - My experiences with problems</h1>

    <h2>I don't speak that language!<h2>
    <p>Travelling is always exciting and memorable, but one thing about it always seems difficult.
      Going to English speaking countries are no problem, but the moment you go to a country that speaks a foreign language, even the simplest of conversations becomes a rather daunting task.
      This is what my problems so far with coding has been. Most of the problems were because I knew what to do, and I knew how I should approach it, but I didn’t know how to speak the language of code, and therefore, didn’t know about the specifics I required to take.
      <br>
      In order to overcome these problems, I had to use a lot of problem solving techniques, just like you would when you travel to a foreign country.
      I pulled up Google, I *tried* to speak the language, I tried to apply what I know, and I had to ask the people around me for help.
      <br>
      How did I feel throughout this process? Excited. Learning new things always appears intimidating at the start, but once you understand, and apply, the feeling of accomplishment is great.
      Using what you’ve learnt in a real life setting is one of the greatest feelings out there. Everything new is a learning process, and this is how I wish to approach my learning experience, and everything new may seem daunting, but I will learn it and enjoy it.
    </p>



    <h2>Solving my own problems<h2>
    <p>In Sprint 4, there were a lot of learning exercises called “Kata” where we had to apply what we had learnt into real scenarios and tests.
      There were many different problems, each with different solutions and methods.
      <br>
      One of the great things about the Kata were, that I could apply different problem solving techniques to them.
      I started with pseudocode to plan out my methods, then I would attempt the code,  then I would talk to my “rubber ducky” and realise in monologue that I was doing something wrong.
      I was able to get better at reading and understanding error messages as well as utilising the console log to view and correct the errors I had made.
      Lastly, if I was ever too stuck on a problem, I always had our trusty Google and my friends and colleagues to ask for help.
      <br>
      Throughout the process of sprint 4, I feel that my understanding of code has compiled itself together, and all the loose pieces that I had floating around in my head began to for an actual picture.
      This felt great, as for the past few sprints, I was just learning things and memorising them, not really knowing how to apply them, but for sprint 4, having the chance to combine them all felt great.
      I think one of the best things and most important things that I learnt from sprint 4 is that although I had my doubts, I can do it if I just try.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflections of my problem solving<h2>
    <p>The problem solving techniques that I used were all of the things that we were told to use. They include: <br>
      pseudocode, trying something, the rubber ducky method, reading error messages, console log, googling, asking peers for help,
      asking coaches for help and improving processes with reflecting.
      <br>
      Of all of these, I think that I was able to do all of them well except for asking other for help.
      The reason that I found it difficult to ask others for help was because I firstly found myself feeling apologetic to ask others, and the second was that I didn’t want to feel stupid.
      On a couple of the questions, I really needed some clarification, and I asked my peers, and they were all extremely helpful about it, and it made me feel ashamed that I had thought of them as hard to approach.
      I understand that I will be working in team environments, so I wan’t to be able to approach and be approachable as a team member.
