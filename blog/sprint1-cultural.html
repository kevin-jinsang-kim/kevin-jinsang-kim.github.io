    <h1>Sprint 1 Cultural - Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>

    <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
    <p>Life or death situations are always a difficult choice. Especially if your decisions decide the outcome of not yourself, but others’ lives. Working as a pharmacist, there have been countless times where people were unable to afford or arrange their medications. Some medicines, not so important, which I would just have to send them away, but some were life or death situations. Although it may seem like an obvious choice to help someone, but the boundaries as a health professional often made that choice difficult. To be frank, your licence and furthermore, livelihood depends on the professional expectations of you. I could go on and on, but to be short:
    </p>
    <p>The wellbeing of the patients were much more important to me than a few dollars, so if I decided that they needed their medicines but couldn’t afford it, I paid on their behalf. Hey, I became a pharmacist to help people, and that’s exactly what I did!</p>


    <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>

    <p>
      “Culture” is a very strange concept for me. I don’t think that I really fit fully into one culture, having grown up in New Zealand since I was 5. I think culture, to me, is something that isn’t black or white, but is a spectrum. Having grown up within so many cultures, it has allowed me to have a much wider viewpoint and understanding of people. Due to this wider stance on culture, it has allowed me to be much more accepting of differences, as well as understanding that opinions, no matter how wrong you view them, may be the right answer to different people. I think that culture has influenced me to become a very flexible and fluid person.

    <h2>Strengths and Limitations
    </h2>
    <p>Through experience and feedback, I know that flexibility, kindness and quick learning are my biggest strengths. My flexibility extends not only to my work ethics, but to how I interact with people and solve problems. Kindness is something that I’ve always been taught and have grown up seeing and acting on. Due to these two strengths, I have never had any problems with people, and have gotten along really well with everyone that I’ve met. Being a quick learner has also helped me to learn new things and develop myself, not only at work, but pretty much in everything.
    </p>

    <h2>Example from my experience of where I was trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
    </h2>
    <p>From experience, there have been extremely few situations where I haven’t been able to work productively with someone. I was younger, and being the boss, I had expectations from staff. One of the staff was failing to meet expectations, and I tried to get them to do something that they didn’t want to do, but had to do. I quickly realised that I had no way of changing that staff’s mind, as I realised that what I thought was something correct may have not been correct to them. Once I understood that what I deem correct may be incorrect to others, I delegated the work and the other staff all understood and were helpful, and the tension between me and that staff was gone, and to this day, we’re still good friends.
