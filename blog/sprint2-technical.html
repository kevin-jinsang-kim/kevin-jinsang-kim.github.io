    <h1>Sprint 2 Technical</h1>
    <h2>Inline vs Inline-block<h2>
    <p>The 'display: inline' and 'display: inline-block' functions are used to, well, pretty much display items on the page.</p>
    <p>The 'display: inline' element will display the element side to side like so:</p>
    <p class="text-explain">A little kitten and puppy went to the supermarket and bought <span class="span-a">canned</span> <span class="span-a">tuna</span> for their butler, Human.</p>
    <p>This could be a problem if you wanted to add a specified width and a height to the elements.</p>
    <p>This is where the 'display: inline-block' value comes into the picture:</p>
    <p class="text-explain">A little kitten and puppy went to the supermarket and bought <span class="span-b">canned</span> <span class="span-b">tuna</span> for their butler, Human.</p>
    <p>'display: inline-block' allows a width and height to be added into the element.</p>
    <p>It also respects the top and bottom margin/paddings, which the 'display: inline' does not do.</p>
    <p>Pictures are always helpful in displaying the differences, so here are some examples!<p>
<br>
    <h2>A little extra!<br>display: block</h2>
    <p>One additional point is that 'display: block' is very similar to 'display: inline-block', but it has a break!</p>
    <p class="text-explain">A little kitten and puppy went to the supermarket and bought <span class="span-c">canned</span> <span class="span-c">tuna</span> for their butler, Human.</p>
