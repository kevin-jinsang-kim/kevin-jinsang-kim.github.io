    <h1>Sprint 4 Cultural - Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>Neuroplasticty
    </h2>
    <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
    </h3>
    <p>The medical definition for neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections.
      This means that the brain isn’t a ‘fixed’ system, but a system that can be much more flexible than what we once thought.
      <br>Now, you may ask how this may benefit you, and well, the answer is simple; it’ll allow you to continuously learn and adapt.
    </p>

    <h3>Discuss how might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
    </h3>
    <p>Here’s a personal example of how I’ve used neuroplasticity for my own benefit in learning, and again, it’s really simple. 3.1415926535897932384. That’s the first 20 digits of pi. How do I know?
      Did I just read it once and *POOF* could I remember it? It’s actually a result of neuroplasticity. Back in high-school, being the fun loving person I am, I decided to memorise pi (yeah, fun, sure).
      Took me a few attempts, but now it’s stuck in my head, and this is because neuroplasticity allowed pathways to build in my brain that would otherwise not exist.
      Had I never attempted, I would not have the neural pathway to remember this, and I have the “COOLEST” party trick available now, all thanks to neuroplasticity.
    </p>

    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
    </h3>
    <p>Now the question. How then do we increase neuroplasticity? Let me ask you this. How do you gain muscle mass and maintain it? You just keep using it.
      The key to increasing neuroplasticity is constantly using and challenging the brain. That’s it. Just use, use and use.

    <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging
    </h3>
    <p>Coming from a medical background, I don’t really take things just by word, and often I need solid proof to back it up.
      So here’s an interesting article that shows what and how neuroplasticity affects us. <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933650/>Link to Article</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Growth Mindset
    </h2>

    <h3>What is Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?
    </h3>
    <p>A growth mindset is a mental state where you want your knowledge to grow.
      On the other hand, we have fixed mindset, where your brain decides that it cannot continue, and stays in a fixed state.
      Let’s say that you took a difficult test, and you failed. Do you think to yourself, “I’m a failure, I failed”, or do you think “I’m just not there YET, and I can do this”?
      This is the difference between fixed and growth mindset. When students think that they can get smarter, they understand that the effort they put in will make them stronger.
      They will put in extra time and effort, and this will make the achieve higher goals.
    </p>

    <h3>Did anything surprise me in this exploration? Did anything change me?
    </h3>
    <p>I was really surprised at the results that Dr Carol Dweck presented.
      I have believed for a long time that genetics plays a massive part in learning, and was the majority factor for learning and having educational success.
      Dr Dweck’s results showed that having a growth mindset actually allows people to learn much better, and I now agree that growth mindset is a very important part of learning - alongside with the genetic factor which I still believe is very important.
    </p>

    <h3>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>For me, coding is something very new, and to be brutally honest, I’ve had some times where I thought that I wouldn’t be able to continue, and wanted to give up.
      I always thought that I was smart enough to learn everything I was taught, but it was a lot harder that I thought.
      I just thought that I was too old and my brain was fixed to be a pharmacist.
      Now I know that if I have the correct growth mindset, I will be able to learn, and I believe that I can do this, and I won’t have a fixed mindset telling me that I can’t.
    </p>

    <h3>Link to a resource that I found particularly useful or engaging
    </h3>
    <p>Growth mindset is a concept pretty much developed by Dr Dweck, and while looking around the internet,
      I found <a href=https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/>https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/</a> to be quite interesting and engaging.
    </p>

    <h3>My Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset included learning plans and strategies
    </h3>

    <p>My learning plan at the start was a whole lot of arrogance and faith in myself that I would be capable to just learn things.
      I now know that I require a new mindset and I need to accept that I am a learner and that there will be some difficult things.
      In order to help me with that, I now have a growth mindset which is telling me that I just need to work harder and that I’m not there YET, and I definitely will be as long as I keep pushing harder and harder.
