  <h1>Sprint 2 Cultural - Learning Plan</h1>

  <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?
  </h2>
  <p class="p-left">I wish to achieve success as a developer, not only in the technical field, but in the people field as well. I want to continue developing my career, as this industry has a much higher ceiling than the previous field I was in as a pharmacist.
  </p>

  <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
  </h2>
  <p class="p-left">The skill I would like to see develop in myself the most is to become a better listener. I have always been a talker, and for that reason, I have sometimes forgotten how important it is to listen.
  </p>


  <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations
  </h2>

  <p class="p-left">Flexibility, detail and and quick learning would be my biggest strengths. I’ve always tried to have an open mind and believe that there isn’t always one solution to a problem. I may think I’m right, but to others, I may be wrong. Being able to accept this and being flexible with my opinions has allowed me to become someone that can work under any situation and with any kind of people. In terms of work ethic, I believe that the small details really matter, and as a pharmacist, this has been a very important strength because accuracy and detail is everything. Small things that are often overlooked are things that are equally important to me, and I believe this will help as a developer because I’ll make sure there’s not a single line that’s been overlooked. Quick learning is self-explanatory and learning is something I’ve been doing my whole life so I’ll cut this short!
  </p>
  <p class="p-left">In terms of limitations, I’m only human, so the list may go on, but my biggest limitation would be ‘starting’. I often take a lot of energy to actually start something. I know that if I start, it’ll be fine as I’ll get into it and focus, but it's the starting that really limits me from a lot of things. It’s something that I’ve been getting better at (ie, joining DevAcademy), but its definitely something I still need to work on.
  </p>

  <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
  </h2>
  <p class="p-left">Time management has never really been an issue, as I’ve always been ahead of schedule in whatever I do. As aforementioned, I believe that my biggest hurdle will be actually ‘starting’ whatever I do. In order make myself more productive, I’ll be looking at ways to get focused and start things, and if that’s not the case, I’m sure there will be good friends from DevAcademy there to help me. Working together is about helping each other out, and I am not shy to help or be helped in order to work as an efficient team.
  </p>

  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
  </h2>
  <p class="p-left">Being graceful in accepting defeat is a great skill to have. I know that I am in a learning position, and that I may not be able to do everything myself. Should I end up in a position where I can’t solve something even after discussion and research, I’ll not be shy to ask for help.
  </p>

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
  </h2>
  <p class="p-left">Help when I’m in need, strength when I am weak, and jobs when I am unemployed. On a less joking tone, I’m sure the experience that the facilitators have in the field will be a great thing to learn, and it would be great to get that experience passed on.
  </p>

  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
  </h2>
  <p class="p-left">I don’t have any planned commitments, but I’m sure there may be some social plans in the future which I’ll be placing behind DevAcademy when prioritising, as I wish to learn as much as I can in the 9 weeks of bootcamp. I want to be fully committed to DevAcademy.
